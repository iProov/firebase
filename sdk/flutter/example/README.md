# Example

## Setup

All Firebase files are .gitignored by default.

So you will need to use the `flutterfire configure --project <your_firebase_project_id>` to integrate your Firebase Project with this example app. 

This will generate the `DefaultFirebaseOptions` class that is consumed in `main.dart`.
